		<div>Nationalist Party Foundation</div>
		<div>    Fellow colleagues, this nation is now in the gravest danger history has ever seen. Its people are rotting, indulging themselves to become lazy, selfish and ungrateful parasites of this nation. 
    There is no respect for hardworking people like us anymore. People take unearned fortune without shame and those who should have been rewarded for their hard work are exploited by the very same government that has sworn to protect them. 
    A thousand years ago, this great nation was founded by millions of hardworking souls. The sweat they have spent and the blood they have shed are the bedrock of this nation's idea and spirit. Ever since we entered the era of total automation, people started dropping their burdens and responsibilities to machines. The automated lifestyle does make us lazy and impatient, but the true devil that causes the corruption of our souls is none other than the ridiculously generous welfare the government has issued 10 years ago. 
    It is shocking to see how both Democrats and Republicans standing side by side on THIS matter after so many years. People now can have a decent life even if they do nothing but browsing their social media accounts for their entire lives. What is the meaning of our existence if all we do is nothing but living like pigs? The government promised to feed these parasites, and their funding for this welfare program is, of course, from the heavy taxation on the working class. Now hardworking people like us need to feed not only the criminals but also a bunch of couch potatoes. 
    Someone has to stand out and say no to such tyranny. This party is founded to put a stop on this madness and save our country from corruption. Our goal is to rewrite the welfare legislation and restore the idea of hardworking and earning that makes this nation great in the first place. Our group is still powerless right now but there is a spark of hope. One day, we will form a great army to change the country from its rotten roots. Fellow colleagues, today will be the first meeting of the Blue Nationalist Party. It is a historical moment that we shall all remember.

</div>
